# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

In this segment we will show 3 different user-activity diagrams that shows how a user would use our website.

The diagrams below show how a non-authorized user will use the "Chirp!" application there are 2 different but very similar looking diagrams. The left one is how a user who has registered on the site but is not logged in yet. The right one show a user who has not yet registered themselves as a user.

The diagram below shows how an authorized user will use the "Chirp!" application it is shown as a loop since most of the tasks that a user can do will still end up with them at the front page looking at cheeps. We omitted how they interact with the "about me" page and the "my timeline" page. For the "my timeline" page what a user can interact with is about the same as public timeline the cheeps are just different. For the "about me" page we omitted it since the things a user can can change their information and the diagram would look almost identical to the 2 previous diagrams in this section.

## Sequence of functionality/calls through _Chirp!_

# Process

Here comes a description of our Process.

## Build, test, release, and deployment

In this section we will discuss our continuous deployment of the Chirp software using GitHub Actions. We will provide an in depth explanation of how our continuous deployment tackles building the program, testing, deploying to the web platform, and ensuring working releases for all relevant platforms. Lastly we will discuss how dependencies are tackled using dependabot.

### Building

To build the program we use the "build_and_test.yml" workflow. This workflow runs on pushes and pulls to the main branch, this is to view the status of our tests whenever something gets added or possibly merged. In the workflow, the 3 first steps are responsible for building the program before testing. The first step is "Setup .NET" which uses "actions/setup-dotnet@v3", with dotnet version 7.0. This is responsible for setting up the program before building it, and is a part of the "action/checkout@v3" collection. The next step is to restore dependencies, which is done by running "dotnet restore src/Chirp.Razor" this simply runs this in the commandline as a necessary build step to ensure all our dependencies are restored. Lastly we run the "Build" step which runs the "dotnet build src/Chirp.Razor --no-restore" command, which essentially responsible for building the program so that it now can be tested upon.   

### Testing

Running the tests is done with the last step in the "build_and_test.yml" workflow file. This step is called "Test" and runs the command "dotnet test test/test.Chirp --no-build --verbosity normal", which runs our tests. We have put alot of thought and effort into having the correct and necessary tests such as; end to end (also called E2E), Integration, and unit tests. These tests are done with the Triple A principle in mind (arrange, act and assert).

#### Unit tests
The unit tests are designed to test the different units of the program. We do this using the triple A principle, of arranging acting and asserting. This is a structured way of designing and performing tests to ensure a level of consistency throughout the tests. It is important to consistently and rigourisly test the many different units of the program since we must isolate the written code to test and determine (pass or fail) if it works as intended. 
(Insert unit test example) 

#### Triple A principle
Using the triple A principle, of arranging acting and asserting we always have a consistent way of testing. This methodology revolves around first arranging your test, this means inputting and creating the necessary data structures that we might want to test. We then act upon them by affecting the data and testing some method. Lastly we assert what we expect from our result and compare to what we get, these should correspond. This is a structured way of designing and performing tests to ensure a level of consistency throughout the tests. These are criteria we have set for our unit test to ensure their validity and usefulness to evaluate whether a functionality works as intended.

#### In memory 


#### Playwright

### Release 
The intended use of the release.yml workflow is to create and release zip files, for windows mac and linux where the program can be found and ran. We have designed our release workflow so that it runs using a for loop, to reduce redundancy. Furthermore our there are certain requirements for our release workflow to run which we view as crucial for the design of the worklow. The first major requirement our workflow has, is that it only runs once a tag has been pushed. This is important since all releases require a tag, furthermore this allows us to describe our tag format so that we are consistent when creating our tags. This can be seen on line 6 in the workflow where the tag format is "v*.*.*" which is in accordance with Semantic versioning (breaking.feature.fix) from session_03. The next major requirement in our release workflow is that we have added the "build_and_test.yml" as a job which needs to run and complete appropriately, meaning the program must build correctly and all the tests must pass, before the release job runs. This results in a uml diagram of workflows looking like this: 
![UML Diagram of workflows](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/SoWkIImgAStDuN8gpSn9YK_CIualIIqkqQlCpL7GjLC8Iir9JInE1NEj58fI2qipYr9J599Iq_ABKe5ya6ncNZgNGsfU2j0K0000)

This is a suitable requirement since we would never want to release a version of the program where the tests do not pass, meaning some units dont work as intended. 

### Deploy

## Team work

We do not have any unfinished issues on our project board we have made all the features that we set out to make, one part of our program that we could have worked more on would have been to add more test though, specifically for our wild style features.

The process we went through was we would meet when new tasks where given to make new issues. Usually it was 2 people who sat and made the new issues who these where changed between weeks. The other people would work on previous tasks we maybe hadn't completed yet. We would then delegate the new issues between us sometimes 2 or 3 people would work on one issue using pair programming otherwise it would be 1 person working on 1 issue. We would also make a new branch, specifically for that issue. We where not great at using the project board and would often put an issue up on the project board in the in progress column and then forget about the project board. Then 2 weeks later put the issue over in the done column if the issue was solved. If we felt that an issue was solved we would then make a pull request to merge to main. Then most of the time another member of the team who hadn't worked on the issue would review and approve the merge, but if no one answered the messages for a pull request. One of the team members who worked on the issue would approve and merge themselves. We did this, so we wouldn't have branches that didn't get used for more than a day.

## How to make _Chirp!_ work locally

## How to run test suite locally
To run our in memory tests and unit tests, start by standing at the root of the directory called Chirp. Then from the terminal type ->
cd test/test.Chirp after that run the command -> dotnet test. Within the inMemoryTests.cs file you will find test suites that tests various database methods which lies within the AuthorRepository, CheepRepository and FollowerListRepository. It starts by creating a new database after that it establishes a connection to the database and then seeds it with various cheeps and authors. We use the typical Arrange, Act and Assert notation to test the different repository methods. Once the tests are completed we dispose of the database and all the cheeps and authors within it. 

In our UnitTestChirp.cs file you will find some out-commented unit tests. These are all methods that are not in use anymore or they fail which then stops our action workflow from deploying. We chose to use the inLineData format for the tests, this was to test different values on a single method at once. Some of the tests consist of testing the web application such as being able to see the public/private timeline or finding specific users cheeps.   

To see our playwright tests stand at the root of our directory Chirp then type in the terminal -> cd test/PlaywrightTests once you are in the directory type -> dotnet test this will run various Razor web application tests. all of the methods starts by connecting to our Azure front webpage. The PlayWright tests works by calling different methods from the Playwright library. these methods are for example GetByRole() or GetByPlaceholder() which essentially finds the desired text field/button and then calls the methods such as FillAsync() or ClickAsync() which fills the field with text or clicks a button respectively. Once that is done and it is on the correct page with the correct information we call the Expect method to check that the correct text is found and if so the test succeeds. 
 
# Ethics

Here we talk about our Ethics.

## License
To choose the license we started by looking at the website https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ to learn which license would fit our needs best, we immediately noticed the different types of permissions conditions and limitations. our group confirmed we wanted as few limitations and conditions as possible because it would be easier for the public to use our code. We Came to the conclusion to choose the MIT license. Just to be sure we asked our TA at one of our meetings if the license was suitable for our project and dependencies. He agreed and we opted for the MIT license.     

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
